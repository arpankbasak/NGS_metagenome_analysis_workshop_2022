## Learning objectives:
1.	This workshop aims to address the power and limitation of NGS based analysis
2.	Attendees will be learning the approach of processing NGS data from sequencing output and data analysis strategies.
3.	Data visualization and interpretation of metagenome analysis.
4.	Attendees will get an idea of the NGS tools used in the metagenome analysis.
5.	Attendees will be able to have a hands-on experience in both amplicon sequencing and shot-gun sequencing data using QIIME and DADA2 pipeline.

## Pre-requisites:
1.	Laptop and un-interrupted internet.
2.	[Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html)/[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) interface (if possible).
3.	[R](https://cran.r-project.org), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) and active terminal to access commandline. In case you dont want to download the RStudio you can use the [RStudio cloud](https://rstudio.cloud)
